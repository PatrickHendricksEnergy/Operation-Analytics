# Data Ethics

## Principles
- Use data only for intended analytical purposes.
- Avoid exposing personal or sensitive information in reports or exports.
- Do not fabricate metrics; document missingness and limitations.
- Keep analysis reproducible and auditable.

## Privacy & PII
- Treat supplier, buyer, and customer identifiers as sensitive fields.
- Share aggregated results whenever possible.
- Remove or mask PII before external distribution.

## Bias & Fairness
- Validate that supplier or buyer performance comparisons reflect comparable conditions.
- Avoid over-interpreting correlations as causation.

## Transparency
- Document assumptions and limitations in every report.
- Clearly indicate where data coverage is partial or missing.
